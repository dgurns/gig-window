- **Are you a musician who wants to learn how to code?** Have a look at [good first issues](https://github.com/dgurns/gig-window/labels/good%20first%20issue) and take a stab. Assign the issue to yourself when you are starting, so no one else takes it by mistake. Feel free to ask for help and we will do the best we can to help you get started.

## Why am I doing this?

I was crushed when Concert Window went out of business. We had created such a cool community and people really depended on it. When the company died, it all disappeared.

Then the coronavirus hit. If only we had made it long enough! People needed Concert Window like never before.

Since the demise of Concert Window, I learned how to code and I’m now a full time software engineer. As a personal challenge – and as a way to stave off lockdown boredom – I decided to see if I could rebuild Concert Window from scratch and publish the source code to the community.

Now this tool will always be available to people no matter what happens.

I want to run this as a sustainable project for the community, and to do that I need your help. If you would like to participate, here’s how:

- If you’re a musician, play shows!
- If you’re a fan, watch shows and support the artists
- If you’d like to help others, solve people’s support questions in the [Discussions]() tab (Github will enable this when the project has 3 contributors)
- If you’re a coder or a musician who wants to become one, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/dgurns/gig-window/compare) or [bug report](https://github.com/dgurns/gig-window/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+Title) here on Github. One of my goals is to help musicians upskill and I pledge to spend extra time helping musicians who want to learn how to code.

Thank you!
