## Why am I doing this?

I was crushed when Concert Window went out of business. We had created such a cool community and people really depended on it. When the company died, it all disappeared.

Then the coronavirus hit. If only we had made it long enough! People needed Concert Window like never before.

Since the demise of Concert Window, I learned how to code and I‚Äôm now a full time software engineer. As a personal challenge ‚Äì and as a way to stave off lockdown boredom ‚Äì I decided to see if I could rebuild Concert Window from scratch and publish the source code to the community.

Now this tool will always be available to people no matter what happens.

I want to run this as a sustainable project for the community, and to do that I need your help. If you would like to participate, here‚Äôs how:

- If you‚Äôre a musician, play shows!
- If you‚Äôre a fan, watch shows and support the artists
- If you‚Äôd like to help others, add some common questions and answers to the [Wiki](https://github.com/dgurns/gig-window/wiki) or help answer questions in live chat on https://gigwindow.com. 
- If you‚Äôre a coder or a musician who wants to become one, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/dgurns/gig-window/compare) or [bug report](https://github.com/dgurns/gig-window/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+Title) here on Github. One of my goals is to help musicians upskill and I pledge to spend extra time helping musicians who want to learn how to code.

Thank you!
